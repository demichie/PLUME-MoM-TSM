This folder contains the input files to reproduce the two test cases presented in Costa et al. (2016) for strong and weak plumes.

Parameters for strong plume test are:
	
Vent elevation: 1500 m 
Mass Flow Rate: 1.5x10^9 kg/s
Exit Velocity: 275 m/s
Exit Temperature: 1053 K
Exit Water Fraction: 5.0 wt%
Particle size distribution: coarse class at Φ=1 with ρ=2500 kg/m^3
                            fine class at Φ=6 with ρ=2700 kg/m^3

Parameters for weak plume test are:
	
Vent elevation: 1500 m 
Mass Flow Rate: 1.5x10^6 kg/s
Exit Velocity: 135 m/s
Exit Temperature: 1273 K
Exit Water Fraction: 3.0 wt%
Particle size distribution: coarse class at Φ=0 with ρ=2200 kg/m^3
                            fine class at Φ=4 with ρ=2700 kg/m^3
