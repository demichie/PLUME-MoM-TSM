**** VESUVIUS EXAMPLE ****

New scripts: plot_concentration_FL.sh and plot_concentration_FL.py to plot the results of HYSPLIT according to ICAO requirements 
for ash contamination levels.

Low contamination <= 2g m-3
Medium contamination >2 <4 gm-3
High contamination >= 4 gm-3

3 Flight Levels: FL200, FL350 and FL550

The scripts provided in this folder have been written by F.Pardini(1) and M.de' Michieli Vitturi(1)

To run a PlumeMoM & Hysplit simulation

1. Edit input_file.py 

2. Execute run_plumemom_hysplit.sh   - To run the PlumeMoM & Hysplit simulation

3. Execute create_plots.sh           - HYSPLIT plotting routines for solid particles and gas concentrations

4. Execute plot_ground_mass.sh       - To plot the deposit

5. Execute extract_samples.sh        - To extract particles mass loading at specific lat-lon locations (see input_file.py)

6. Execute calculate_solid_mass.sh   - To compute the mass of solid material in the domain 

7. Execute calculate_gas_mass.sh     - To compute the mass of volcanic gases in the domain

8. Execute clean_all.py              - To clean the working directory

From point 3 to point 8 the execution order can be varied by the user
