This folder contains the input file for a simulation with the option for the umbrella cloud spreading activated.
Two additional namelists are needed for this kind of simulation.

&UMBRELLA_RUN_PARAMETERS
 T_END=  14400.000000000000001E-00,
 DT_OUTPUT=  600.00000000000000E-00,
 /

&NUMERIC_PARAMETERS
 RSOURCE_CELLS = 5, 
 SOLVER_SCHEME="KT",
 DT0 = 1.0E-1 ,
 MAX_DT=  50.0000000000000000E-000,
 CFL= 0.2490000000000000000     ,
 LIMITER= 1 1 1 1 1          ,
 THETA=  1.300000000000000     ,
 RECONSTR_COEFF=  1.0000000000000000     ,
 N_RK= 2,

The simmulation of the umbrella cloud is done with a transient model, running until the time T_END is reached or until the upwind spreading reaches a steady condition.


For this simulation the initial TGSD is not provided through values of mu and sigma, but giving the initial mass fractions associated to the bins with a namelist. This is obtained by setting the parameter DISTRIBUTION="BIN" in the namelist PARTICLES_PARAMETERS.
Then a new namelist is needed:

&BIN_PARAMETERS
 BIN_PARTIAL_MASS_FRACTION = 1.9E-03 , 1.1E-02, 4.3E-02 ,1.1E-01 ,2.1E-01, 2.5E-01, 2.1E-01 ,1.1E-01, 4.3E-02, 1.1E-02, 1.9E-03, 2.2E-04, 1.7E-05, 9.3E-07, 3.4E-08, 8.2E-10, 1.4E-11, 1.5E-13, 3.4E-08, 9.3E-07, 1.7E-05, 2.2E-04, 1.9E-03, 1.1E-02, 4.3E-02, 1.1E-01, 2.1E-01, 2.5E-01, 2.1E-01, 1.1E-01, 4.3E-02, 1.1E-02, 1.9E-03, 2.2E-04, 1.7E-05, 9.3E-07
 /

Here there are 36 values, the first 18 are the mass fractions for the first family of particles (from the phi bin [-6;-5] to the phi bin [11;12]). The second 18 are for the second family of particles.


A python script is provided to plot the output of the model:

> python plot_3D.py column_and_umbrella.col
