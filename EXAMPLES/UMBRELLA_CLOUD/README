This folder contains the input file for a simulation with the option for the umbrella cloud spreading activated.
Two additional namelists are needed for this kind of simulation.

 T_END=  14400.000000000000001E-00,
 DT_OUTPUT=  600.00000000000000E-00,

The simmulation of the umbrella cloud is done with a transient model, running until the time T_END is reached or until the upwind spreading reaches a steady condition.

A python script is provided to plot the output of the model:

> python plot_3D.py column_and_umbrella.col
